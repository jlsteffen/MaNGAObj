Move/copy the files from the '4.remov_overdebl' directory to the final table folder. Then move/copy the manually updated files from '6.add_object', '7.recenter', and '8.partial_overlap' here and overwrite the original files. This folder should contain tables for each MaNGA observation which contain the positions of all objects after removing false positives, adding missed objects, reentering the observation target, and adding in objects on the IFU border.
